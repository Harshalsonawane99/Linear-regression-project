# Linear Regression with Python 📈

## Overview

This repository contains a beginner-friendly **Linear Regression** project implemented in **Python**, aimed at building a strong foundation in **data science, statistics, and machine learning**. The project follows a complete end-to-end workflow, from understanding the problem statement to drawing business insights from the model.

The dataset represents customers who purchase clothes online after attending in-store personal styling sessions. Customers can place orders either via a **mobile application** or a **website**. The main objective is to analyze customer behavior and help the company decide which platform should be prioritized for improvement.

## Problem Statement

The company wants to determine whether to focus more on enhancing the **mobile app experience** or the **website**, based on factors that influence customer spending.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes features related to customer behavior such as:

* Time spent on the website
* Time spent on the mobile app
* Length of membership
* Other relevant customer attributes

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data preprocessing using NumPy and Pandas
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Building a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
5. Model evaluation and interpretation
6. Business insights and conclusions

## Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* scikit-learn

## Key Learnings

* Understanding linear regression fundamentals
* Applying statistical learning concepts in Python
* Interpreting regression coefficients
* Using machine learning for data-driven decision making

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical introduction to regression analysis and demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to solve real-world business problems.
